# 7 Wonders Of The World + AI Chatbot

In my HTML project, I have made a simple and informative website about the 7 wonders. It's features:
*7 Wonders (Great Wall, Petra, Christ the Redeemer, Machu Picchu, Chichen Itza, Colosseum, and Taj Mahal)
*Has clickable links images
*Styled with a bright yellow background and a scrolling marquee header
*Chatbot powered by Gemini API key. (For Python - import google.generativeai as genai)
*Also note I cite ChatGPT for it's debugging, and it corrected some bugs, so credits to ChatGPT.

>⚠️Please remember that if you find that the chatbot does not work, there is no API Key. If you would like to get an API Key, go to
