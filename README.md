# 7 Wonders Of The World + AI Chatbot

In my HTML project, I have made a simple and informative website about the 7 wonders. It's features:<br>

1. 7 Wonders (Great Wall, Petra, Christ the Redeemer, Machu Picchu, Chichen Itza, Colosseum, and Taj Mahal)<br>

2. Has clickable links images<br>

3. Styled with a bright yellow background and a scrolling marquee header<br>

4. Chatbot powered by Gemini API key. (For Python - import google.generativeai as genai)<br>

5. Also note I cite ChatGPT for it's debugging, and it corrected some bugs, so credits to ChatGPT.<br>


>⚠️Please remember that if you find that the chatbot does not work, there is no API Key. If you would like to get an API Key, go to
